In Animal Crossing: New Horizons there are a limited number of maps that players can choose from as a starting island layout. Our Animal Crossing Map Generator is a program that can create unique maps. We wanted to create a program to generate more “starter mlaps” while still using the same island rules. The rules were determined based on observation of all the layout maps and a map designer website that also provided guidance for implementation. In our Animal Crossing Map Generator we implemented sand, grass, water mouths, and rocks. Our approach was to complete each feature as a layer on top of another on an image using different algorithms to achieve the authentic rugged island look.
